### Always visualise your data
This is the quickest and most convincing example I’ve seen that one should always visualise one’s data and not rely on statistical summaries alone. The link shows the Datasaurus Dozen, 12 +1 datasets that have the same means, SDs and correlations, but obviously are completely different. Further down the page they also show that box plots too can hide a huge amount of information.

Note: the link describes a paper (Matejka, J., & Fitzmaurice, G. (2017, May). Same stats, different graphs...), in which the authors provide ways to create these different datasets with same stats; you don’t need to read the paper, just seeing the animations on the website should be enough to stop you from using bar graphs and similar visualisations that don’t show individual data points. Make sure to look at the animations for boxplots too
