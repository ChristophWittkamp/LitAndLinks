### Introduction to Statistics

Here's two free online textbooks aimed at undergrad psychology students. Since most of us got shitty stats education, they're a good way to brush it up or relearn. They're both focussing on frequentist statistics, but have a chapter dedicated to Bayesian stats. If you want to learn Bayesian stats instead, have a look at _BayesianStatistics.md_ instead.

Danielle Navarrao: [Learning statistics with R](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/)
Russ Poldrack: [Statistical thinking for the 21st century](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-core-site/)

Both use R and both can be used pretty interchangeably as far as I can tell. I read through Navarro's ANOVA chapter and had a peak at Poldrack's book. Navarro's book is very clearly written and as entertaining as a stats textbook can be. I can't say a lot about Poldrack's book. I assume they're both very good introductions, but there's two potential drawbacks that are common to both:

  * They're both introductory, as in they don't cross a certain level of depth. It's enough to apply the stuff and a even a bit beyond that, but you won't actually understand _why_ the central limit theorem works, e.g.. That'scompletely fine for an introductory book but if you want to go deeper, I recommend a formal introduction to probability (see _LearningMathematics.md_). 
  * As far as I can tell they both don't come with dedicated exercises. In my opinion you don't actually learn something without applying it to problems.
