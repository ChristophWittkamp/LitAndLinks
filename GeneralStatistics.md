### Introduction to Statistics
Supposed to be a very good general introduction to statistics using R, so you learn some R one the way if you don’t know it yet. There’s ports for other languages as well. Haven’t done it myself but it is supposed to be very good and contains what you should know after an introductory stats course in psychology undergrad.
