This Comment in Nature is probably the most accessible article on why some people want to abandon statistical significance, signed by >800 researchers and statisticians

Amrhein, V., Greenland, S., & McShane, B. (2019). Scientists rise up against statistical significance. Nature

This is the editorial of a special issue (2019) on the (mis)use of p-values. In the editorial, the American Statistical Association advocates against the use of statistical significance and summarises the diverse opinions of the remaining articles of the special edition

Wasserstein, R. L., Schirm, A. L., & Lazar, N. A. (2019). Moving to a world beyond “p< 0.05”.

The McShane article is a similar Amrhein et al., but more detailed (and was published in the same issue as Wasserstein et al.).

In this brief Viewpoint, John Ioannidis argues for statistical significance and against the articles mentioned above (that suggest abandoning statistical significance: Amrhein et al., Wasserstein et al.)
